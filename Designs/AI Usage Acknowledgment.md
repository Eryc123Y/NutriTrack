# AI Usage Acknowledgment for NutriTrack Project

This document acknowledges the use of foundation models and generative AI tools in the completion of this coding assignment, in accordance with Monash University’s AI policy and the specific assessment instructions provided for this course.

## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/))**: Used as an assistive tool for:
  - Designing the Android app architecture
  - Planning the navigation structure
  - Discussing Kotlin best practices
  - Generating example data models
  - Reviewing API integration approaches
  - Suggesting UI/UX improvements

- **GitHub Copilot**: Used as an AI pair programmer to:
  - Provide Kotlin code suggestions
  - Generate boilerplate code for Android components
  - Suggest implementation patterns for data classes
  - Assist with API integration code

- **Gemini**: Used as an AI-powered coding assistant for:
  - Kotlin code generation
  - Android component implementation
  - Navigation setup suggestions
  - Data persistence patterns

## How AI Was Used

AI tools were employed strictly as assistive resources to support the development of the NutriTrack Android application. Core architecture decisions, data models, and app features were independently conceived and implemented. AI suggestions were carefully reviewed and modified to ensure compliance with Android development best practices and project requirements.

AI was used to:
- Explore different approaches to implementing nutrition tracking features
- Identify potential improvements in the app’s architecture
- Review and enhance documentation
- Suggest efficient data persistence strategies
- Provide guidance on Android UI component implementation

## Prompts or Instructions Given to AI

Examples of prompts and instructions provided to AI tools include:
- “Suggest an efficient data model structure for tracking nutritional information”
- “Review this navigation setup for potential improvements”
- “Help implement a clean architecture pattern for the nutrition tracking feature”
- “Suggest best practices for implementing API integration”
- “Review UI components for accessibility compliance”

## Extent of AI Contribution

AI tools provided guidance and suggestions to support the development process. All final code, architecture, and features reflect independent implementation. AI-generated content served as a reference point, not as the final implementation. I take full responsibility for the accuracy and quality of the submitted work. All AI-suggested content was critically evaluated and adapted to meet project requirements.

## Compliance Confirmation

I confirm that the use of AI tools in this project complies with the assessment requirements of this course and adheres to Monash University’s policies on academic integrity and responsible AI use.

## Reflection on AI Usage

The use of AI tools significantly enhanced my learning experience by exposing me to Android development best practices and efficient solutions. This allowed me to focus on understanding and implementing core concepts rather than getting bogged down in minor details. However, I ensured I fully understood and could explain every part of the submitted code, demonstrating my learning outcomes and capabilities.

## Edits and Changes Made

AI-suggested code and designs were thoroughly reviewed and modified to ensure:
- Proper implementation of Android architecture components
- Adherence to Kotlin best practices
- Consistency with project requirements
- Documentation was revised based on AI feedback
- Project structure was organized following best practices while maintaining independent decision-making

## Important Notes

- The use of AI tools complies with Monash University’s academic integrity policies.
- I take full responsibility for the content and quality of the submitted work.
- AI tools were used as supportive resources only, not to replace independent work.
- All implementations reflect my personal understanding and effort.

## Declaration

I confirm that all uses of generative artificial intelligence and foundation models in this assignment have been appropriately acknowledged, and the submitted work is primarily my own. I understand and accept full responsibility for the originality, accuracy, and ethical standards of this submission, in compliance with Monash University’s policies on academic integrity and responsible AI use.
